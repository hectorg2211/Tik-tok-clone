# Tik Tok React Clone

[Tik Tok Live Site](https://tiktok-clone-hectorg2211.netlify.app/)

## How I worked on this project

My goal was replicate some functionality of the famous tik tok app.

- I built this app based on the tik tok design

## How to navigate this project

- Scroll through the inner screen that displays the videos
- Each video van be liked an the number of likes increment
- The video _snaps_ to the screeb giving it fluid look

## What I used to create this app

- React to build video, video footer and video sidebar components
- Material UI for the icons
- Firebase to store and fetch the tik tok videos and their corresponding data
- React - ticker to allow the video music title to move sideways
- SCSS for styling all the components
- Basic CSS animation for the spinning record

## Why I built the project this way

- To get a hang on the useEffect and useState hooks which helped alot
  due to the fact that the app needed to keep track of which video was playing
  and pause it when another video was selected

## If I had more time I would change this

- Make videos pause when another snaps on the screen
- Send the user to the tik tok account when clicking con the channel
- Make the screen responsive to keep aspect ratio
